## Recommendation

### PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION ✅

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ All 21 categories comprehensively documented
2. ✅ Critical quantitative categories (19-21) fully expanded
3. ✅ Integration matrices comprehensive with code examples
4. ✅ Phase 1 & 2 roadmaps detailed enough for execution
5. ✅ 16,926 lines is sufficient for implementation (80% of ideal)
6. ✅ Agile approach: Expand supporting docs organically during development

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Review PROJECT_TODO.md for implementation roadmap
2. ✅ Begin Phase 1 Week 1: Project setup & Categories 1-2
3. 📝 Expand Parts 22-26 as needed during implementation (not blocking)
4. 🚀 Start building the qualitative pipeline
5. 🚀 Build the quantitative pipeline
6. 🎯 Target: Operational system in 8 weeks (Phase 1)

**Time to Value:**
- **Option A (Finish docs):** 1-2 days to reach 19k lines, THEN start implementation
- **Option B (Start now - RECOMMENDED):** Start implementation TODAY, expand docs as needed

**Recommendation:** **Option B** - The taxonomy is comprehensive enough. Start building!
