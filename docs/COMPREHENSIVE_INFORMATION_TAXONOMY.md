## 📈 **Integration Strategy: How Information Flows Into Analysis**

### **Stage 1: Data Extraction** (Minutes 0-5)
```python
# Parallel scraping of all sources
data = {
    'official': scrape_racing_com(race_id, horses),  # Form, trials, trackwork
    'stewards': scrape_racing_victoria(race_id, horses),  # Stewards, vet reports
    'weather': fetch_bom_weather(venue, date),  # BOM forecast
    'track': fetch_track_updates(venue, date),  # Rail, bias, rating
    'expert': scrape_expert_sources(race_id),  # Punters, Racenet, Sky
    'odds': fetch_odds_multiple(horses),  # Bookmaker odds
    'social': monitor_social_media(horses, trainers, jockeys),  # Twitter, etc.
}
```

### **Stage 2: Information Synthesis** (Minutes 5-7)
```python
# Per-horse synthesis
for horse in horses:
    horse_profile = {
        'form': analyze_recent_form(data['official'][horse]),
        'distance': assess_distance_suitability(data['official'][horse]),
        'track_condition': assess_condition_preference(data['official'][horse]),
        'barrier': analyze_barrier_impact(data['official'][horse], data['track']),
        'weight': analyze_weight_load(data['official'][horse]),
        'jockey': analyze_jockey_factors(data['official'][horse], data['social']),
        'trainer': analyze_trainer_factors(data['official'][horse], data['social']),
        'trials': assess_trial_form(data['official'][horse]),
        'stewards': extract_stewards_insights(data['stewards'][horse]),
        'intangibles': assess_intangibles(data['social'][horse], data['stewards'][horse]),
    }
```

### **Stage 3: Cross-Horse Analysis** (Minutes 7-8)
```python
# Race-level analysis
race_analysis = {
    'pace_map': generate_speed_map(horses),
    'race_shape': predict_race_shape(horses, data['track']),
    'tempo': assess_tempo_pressure(horses),
    'track_bias': identify_track_bias(data['track'], data['stewards']),
    'weather_impact': assess_weather_impact(data['weather'], horses),
    'expert_consensus': aggregate_expert_tips(data['expert']),
    'market_confidence': analyze_market_movements(data['odds']),
}
```

### **Stage 4: Reasoning & Prediction** (Minutes 8-10)
```python
# Integrated reasoning
predictions = []
for horse in horses:
    score = calculate_composite_score(
        horse_profile[horse],
        race_analysis,
        weights={
            'form': 0.20,
            'distance': 0.15,
            'track_condition': 0.15,
            'barrier': 0.10,
            'weight': 0.10,
            'jockey': 0.10,
            'pace_fit': 0.10,
            'intangibles': 0.05,
            'expert_consensus': 0.05,
        }
    )
    predictions.append({
        'horse': horse,
        'score': score,
        'confidence': calculate_confidence(score, data_completeness),
        'reasoning': generate_reasoning_chain(horse, horse_profile[horse], race_analysis),
    })

# Rank and output
predictions.sort(key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
top_3 = predictions[:3]
value_picks = identify_value_picks(predictions, data['odds'])
```
