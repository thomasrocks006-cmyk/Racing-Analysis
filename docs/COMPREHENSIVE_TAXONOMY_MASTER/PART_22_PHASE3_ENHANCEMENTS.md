## ENHANCEMENT 1: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION

### UK Racing Integration (Month 1-2)
- [ ] Adapt taxonomy for UK racing (different track types, conditions)
- [ ] Integrate Racing Post UK data
- [ ] Build UK-specific features (going stick readings, draw bias at UK tracks)
- [ ] Validate predictions on UK historical data

### US Racing Integration (Month 3-4)
- [ ] Adapt taxonomy for US racing (dirt/turf, different distance units)
- [ ] Integrate Equibase data
- [ ] Build US-specific features (Beyer Speed Figures, track variants)
- [ ] Validate predictions on US historical data

### Hong Kong Racing Integration (Month 5-6)
- [ ] Adapt taxonomy for HK racing (limited tracks, specific conditions)
- [ ] Integrate HKJC data
- [ ] Build HK-specific features (draw bias critical in HK)
- [ ] Validate predictions on HK historical data

**Target:** Multi-jurisdiction system covering AU, UK, US, HK (80%+ global racing market)

## ENHANCEMENT 2: EXOTIC BETS ANALYSIS

### Exacta/Quinella Predictions (Month 1)
- [ ] Build 2-horse combination analyzer
- [ ] Calculate joint win probabilities
- [ ] Optimize for value (overlay bets)
- [ ] Test on historical exotic payouts

### Trifecta/First Four Predictions (Month 2)
- [ ] Build 3-4 horse combination analyzer

- [ ] Train Transformer model (attention mechanism for category relationships)
- [ ] Test neural architecture search (AutoML)
- [ ] Compare to current models

### Reinforcement Learning (Month 3-4)
- [ ] Build RL agent (learn optimal betting strategy)
- [ ] Train on historical races (reward = profit)
- [ ] Test in simulated environment
- [ ] Deploy if outperforms current system

**Target:** 80%+ win prediction accuracy (top 3 selections)
