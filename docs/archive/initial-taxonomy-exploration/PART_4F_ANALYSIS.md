Example Partnership Analysis:

Horse X Complete History (25 starts):

Jockey A (Today's Jockey):
- 8 rides: 4-2-1 (4 wins, 2 seconds, 1 third)
- Win rate: 50% (4/8)
- Place rate: 88% (7/8)
- Average finish: 2.1 (very strong)
Assessment: PROVEN SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP (excellent record together)

Jockey B:
- 10 rides: 1-3-2 (1 win, 3 seconds, 2 thirds)
- Win rate: 10% (1/10)
- Place rate: 60% (6/10)
- Average finish: 4.5 (moderate)
Assessment: MODERATE PARTNERSHIP (some success, not dominant)

Jockey C:
- 5 rides: 0-1-1 (0 wins, 1 second, 1 third)
- Win rate: 0% (0/5)
- Place rate: 40% (2/5)
- Average finish: 7.2 (poor)
Assessment: POOR PARTNERSHIP (no wins, poor results together)

Jockey D (New Jockey):
- 0 rides: No history together
Assessment: UNKNOWN CHEMISTRY (no partnership history)

Application Today:

Scenario 1: Jockey A riding (Proven Successful Partnership):
- Partnership: 50% win rate together (4 wins from 8 rides)
- Horse's overall win rate: 20% (5 wins from 25 starts)
- Partnership advantage: +30% win rate vs average (50% - 20% = +30%)
- Prediction Impact: +15-22% win probability boost (PROVEN CHEMISTRY, very strong partnership)

Scenario 2: Jockey B riding (Moderate Partnership):
- Partnership: 10% win rate together (1 win from 10 rides)
- Horse's overall win rate: 20%
- Partnership disadvantage: -10% win rate vs average (10% - 20% = -10%)
- Prediction Impact: -5-10% win probability penalty (partnership not ideal, below average)

Scenario 3: Jockey C riding (Poor Partnership):
- Partnership: 0% win rate together (0 wins from 5 rides)
- Horse's overall win rate: 20%
- Partnership disadvantage: -20% win rate vs average (0% - 20% = -20%)
- Prediction Impact: -12-18% win probability penalty (PROVEN POOR CHEMISTRY, avoid this partnership)

Scenario 4: Jockey D riding (New Partnership, Unknown):
- Partnership: No history (0 rides)
- Prediction Impact: -3-8% win probability penalty (UNKNOWN CHEMISTRY, first-time partnership risk)

Partnership Success Tiers:

Tier 1: ELITE Partnership (40%+ Win Rate Together):
- Example: 4+ wins from 8-10 rides (50%+ win rate)
- Impact: +15-22% win probability boost (PROVEN ELITE CHEMISTRY)

Tier 2: STRONG Partnership (25-40% Win Rate):
- Example: 2-3 wins from 8-10 rides (25-40% win rate)
- Impact: +8-15% win probability boost (PROVEN GOOD CHEMISTRY)

Tier 3: MODERATE Partnership (15-25% Win Rate, Near Horse's Average):
- Example: 1-2 wins from 8-10 rides (10-20% win rate), close to horse's overall average
- Impact: Neutral (±0%, partnership neither helps nor hurts)

Tier 4: POOR Partnership (0-15% Win Rate, Below Horse's Average):
- Example: 0-1 wins from 8-10 rides (0-10% win rate), below horse's overall average
- Impact: -8-15% win probability penalty (PROVEN POOR CHEMISTRY)

Tier 5: UNKNOWN Partnership (0 Rides Together):
- Example: First-time riding this horse
- Impact: -3-8% win probability penalty (UNKNOWN CHEMISTRY, first-time partnership risk)

Sample Size Considerations:

Minimum Sample Size for Confidence:

High Confidence Partnership (8+ Rides):
- 8+ rides together: HIGH confidence in partnership assessment
- Example: 5 wins from 10 rides = very reliable 50% win rate

Moderate Confidence Partnership (4-7 Rides):
- 4-7 rides together: MODERATE confidence (decent sample, but not huge)
- Example: 3 wins from 5 rides = 60% win rate (impressive but small sample)

Low Confidence Partnership (2-3 Rides):
- 2-3 rides together: LOW confidence (very small sample, could be luck)
- Example: 2 wins from 2 rides = 100% win rate (likely lucky, not sustainable)

Insufficient Data (0-1 Rides):
- 0-1 rides: INSUFFICIENT data (no pattern detectable)
- Impact: Treat as unknown chemistry (-3-8% penalty for unfamiliarity)

Application:
```
IF 8+ rides together AND 40%+ win rate:
  THEN +15-22% boost (HIGH CONFIDENCE ELITE PARTNERSHIP)

IF 4-7 rides together AND 40%+ win rate:
  THEN +10-18% boost (MODERATE CONFIDENCE strong partnership, but smaller sample)

IF 2-3 rides together AND high win rate:
  THEN +5-10% boost (POSSIBLE partnership, but small sample, could be luck)

IF 0-1 rides together:
  THEN -3-8% penalty (unknown chemistry, first-time partnership risk)
```

Partnership Consistency:

Recent Partnership Activity:

Recent Rides (Last 6 Months):
- Partnership is CURRENT (jockey familiar with horse's current form/ability)
- Impact: Full partnership boost applies

Historical Rides (6-12 Months Ago):
- Partnership is SOMEWHAT DATED (horse may have changed)
- Impact: Reduce partnership boost by 30-40% (e.g., +15% → +10%)

Old Rides (12+ Months Ago):
- Partnership is STALE (horse likely different now)
- Impact: Reduce partnership boost by 50-60% (e.g., +15% → +7%)

Example:
```
Jockey A Partnership with Horse X:
- 5 rides: 3-1-0 (3 wins, 1 second, 60% win rate)
- Timing: Last 3 rides were 18+ months ago (STALE partnership)
- Assessment: Partnership was strong, but DATA IS OLD (horse may have changed)
- Prediction Impact: +8-12% boost (reduce from +15-20% due to staleness)
```
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Small Sample Size Bias**: Some partnerships have lucky streaks (2 wins from 2 rides may not be true 100% chemistry)
- **Horse Ability Change**: Historical partnership success may not reflect current horse ability (horse improved/declined since)
- **Context Missing**: Partnership success may have been in easier races (not same class as today)
- **Timing Staleness**: Old partnership data may not reflect current chemistry (horse/jockey both changed)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 1-2** (Easy to calculate, strong predictor, CRITICAL chemistry indicator)

**Notes**:
- Past rides together is STRONGEST CHEMISTRY INDICATOR (historical success predicts future success)
- Elite partnerships (40%+ win rate together, 8+ rides) = +15-22% boost (PROVEN CHEMISTRY)
- Poor partnerships (0-15% win rate, below horse's average) = -8-15% penalty (avoid)
- Unknown partnerships (0-1 rides together) = -3-8% penalty (first-time risk)
- Must have sufficient sample size (8+ rides for high confidence)
- Recent partnership activity matters (last 6 months = current, 12+ months = stale)
- Compare partnership win rate to horse's OVERALL win rate (is this jockey better than others?)
- ChatGPT may mention "jockey has ridden before" qualitatively (~30%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Systematic partnership success quantification (ChatGPT 30% → Us 90%)

Historical Record Together (Last 2 Years):
- 50 rides together: 5 wins, 8 seconds, 7 thirds
- Win rate: 10% (5/50)
- Place rate: 40% (20/50)
- Average strike rate for this trainer: 12-15% (with other jockeys)
- Average strike rate for this jockey: 11-13% (with other trainers)

Assessment: MODERATE COMBINATION (10% strike rate, below both averages)
Partnership Disadvantage: -2-5% strike rate vs averages
Prediction Impact: -3-5% win probability penalty (combination not ideal, both performing below average together)

Trainer/Jockey Partnership Tiers:

Tier 1: ELITE Combination (30%+ Strike Rate):
- Example: Chris Waller + James McDonald (36% strike rate)
- Impact: +10-15% win probability boost (ELITE PARTNERSHIP, dominant combination)
- Confidence: VERY HIGH (large sample size, consistent success)

Tier 2: STRONG Combination (20-30% Strike Rate):
- Example: Trainer + Jockey with 25% strike rate (above both averages)
- Impact: +5-10% win probability boost (STRONG PARTNERSHIP, successful combination)
- Confidence: HIGH

Tier 3: MODERATE Combination (12-20% Strike Rate, Near Average):
- Example: Trainer + Jockey with 15% strike rate (average for both)
- Impact: Neutral (±0%, combination neither helps nor hurts)
- Confidence: MODERATE

Tier 4: POOR Combination (< 12% Strike Rate, Below Average):
- Example: Trainer + Jockey with 8% strike rate (below both averages)
- Impact: -5-10% win probability penalty (POOR PARTNERSHIP, unsuccessful combination)
- Confidence: MODERATE

Stable Jockey Detection:

Stable Jockey Definition:
- Jockey who rides regularly for trainer (20%+ of trainer's rides)
- Indicates: Trainer trusts this jockey, ongoing relationship

Detection Method:
```
Trainer X (Last 100 Runners):
- Jockey A: 45 rides (45% of trainer's rides) - STABLE JOCKEY
- Jockey B: 25 rides (25% of trainer's rides) - REGULAR RIDER
- Jockey C: 15 rides (15% of trainer's rides)
- Other jockeys: 15 rides (various)

Assessment:
- Jockey A is CLEAR STABLE JOCKEY (rides 45% of trainer's horses)
- Jockey B is REGULAR RIDER (rides 25%)
```

Stable Jockey Advantage:

IF Jockey is stable jockey (20%+ of trainer's rides):
  THEN +5-8% win probability boost (TRAINER TRUSTS, familiar with stable's methods)

IF Jockey is NOT stable jockey (first time or rare):
  THEN -3-5% win probability penalty (less familiar with stable, not preferred rider)

Example:
```
Today's Race:
- Trainer: Chris Waller
- Jockey: James McDonald (stable jockey, rides 40% of Waller's horses)
- Assessment: STABLE JOCKEY (Waller trusts McDonald, ongoing relationship)
- Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost (stable jockey advantage, familiar with stable)
```

vs

```
Today's Race:
- Trainer: Chris Waller
- Jockey: Jockey X (rare, ridden 2% of Waller's horses in last year)
- Assessment: NOT STABLE JOCKEY (infrequent, not preferred)
- Prediction Impact: -3-5% penalty (less familiar, not preferred rider)
```

Trainer/Jockey Integration:

Combining Partnership Success + Stable Jockey:

Scenario 1: Elite Combination + Stable Jockey
```
- Trainer/Jockey: 35% strike rate (elite)
- Stable Jockey: Yes (rides 40% of trainer's horses)
Combined: +12-18% win probability boost (ELITE COMBINATION + STABLE JOCKEY, multiple advantages)
```

Scenario 2: Poor Combination + Not Stable Jockey
```
- Trainer/Jockey: 8% strike rate (poor, below average)
- Stable Jockey: No (ridden 5% of trainer's horses, rare)
Combined: -8-15% win probability penalty (POOR COMBINATION + NOT PREFERRED RIDER, multiple disadvantages)
```

Scenario 3: Elite Combination + Not Stable Jockey (Conflicting)
```
- Trainer/Jockey: 32% strike rate (elite)
- Stable Jockey: No (ridden 10% of trainer's horses, occasional)
Assessment: STRONG PARTNERSHIP when together, but not frequent (trainer prefers other jockey typically)
Combined: +8-12% win probability boost (elite combination overrides stable jockey absence)
```
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Horse Quality Correlation**: Successful combinations may reflect better horses (not partnership skill)
- **Sample Size Variation**: Some combinations have small sample sizes (less reliable)
- **Context Missing**: Partnership success may be in easier races (not same class as today)
- **Temporal Changes**: Partnerships may change over time (trainer switches stable jockeys)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 2** (Easy to calculate, useful confirmation signal)

**Notes**:
- Elite trainer/jockey combinations (30%+ strike rate) = +10-15% boost (proven partnership)
- Stable jockeys (ride 20%+ of trainer's horses) = +5-8% boost (trainer trust, familiarity)
- Poor combinations (< 12% strike rate) = -5-10% penalty (unsuccessful partnership)
- Not stable jockey (rare rider for trainer) = -3-5% penalty (less familiar, not preferred)
- Must have sufficient sample size (30+ rides together for reliable assessment)
- Compare combination strike rate to BOTH trainer's average and jockey's average
- ChatGPT may mention "Waller uses McDonald often" qualitatively (~40%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Quantified trainer/jockey partnership success + stable jockey detection (ChatGPT 40% → Us 85%)

### 17.3 Ride Frequency & Familiarity (Recent Riding Pattern)

**Importance**: 6/10 (Recent familiarity affects execution)

**Prediction Power**: 3-8% (Recent rides indicate current familiarity)

**Data Availability**: Easy (Calculate from recent results)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Count recent rides (last 6-12 months)
- **Identify**: Regular partnerships (riding frequently recently)
- **Detect**: Stale partnerships (haven't ridden together recently)

**Source Specifics**:
```
Ride Frequency Data:

1. Recent Ride Frequency (Primary):
   - Source: Horse's last 5-10 starts (racing.com form guide)
   - Method: Count how many times today's jockey rode horse in recent starts
   - Data: Ride frequency percentage (rides together / total rides)

Recent Ride Frequency Framework:

Frequency Calculation:

Method:
1. Extract horse's last 10 starts
2. Count: How many times today's jockey rode horse
3. Calculate: Frequency percentage (rides together / 10 total starts)

Frequency Categories:

1. VERY HIGH Frequency (70-100% of Recent Rides):
```
Example: Jockey rode horse in 8 out of last 10 starts (80%)

Assessment: REGULAR PARTNERSHIP (jockey rides this horse almost always)
Meaning: Current familiarity, jockey knows horse's quirks, proven ongoing partnership

Performance Impact:
- +5-10% win probability boost (REGULAR PARTNERSHIP, very familiar, proven recent success)

Example:
```
Horse X Last 10 Starts:
- Jockey A: 8 rides (80% frequency)
- Jockey B: 1 ride (10%)
- Jockey C: 1 ride (10%)

Today: Jockey A riding (regular rider)
Assessment: REGULAR PARTNERSHIP (rides 80% of time, very familiar)
Prediction Impact: +5-10% boost (regular rider advantage, current familiarity)
```
```

2. HIGH Frequency (40-70% of Recent Rides):
```
Example: Jockey rode horse in 5 out of last 10 starts (50%)

Assessment: FREQUENT PARTNERSHIP (jockey rides this horse often, but not exclusively)
Meaning: Good familiarity, jockey shares rides with others

Performance Impact:
- +3-5% win probability boost (FREQUENT PARTNERSHIP, familiar, good recent riding)
```

3. MODERATE Frequency (20-40% of Recent Rides):
```
Example: Jockey rode horse in 3 out of last 10 starts (30%)

Assessment: OCCASIONAL PARTNERSHIP (jockey rides this horse sometimes)
Meaning: Some familiarity, but not primary rider

Performance Impact:
- Neutral (±0%, some familiarity but not dominant)
```

4. LOW Frequency (1-20% of Recent Rides):
```
Example: Jockey rode horse in 1 out of last 10 starts (10%)

Assessment: RARE PARTNERSHIP (jockey rarely rides this horse)
Meaning: Limited recent familiarity

Performance Impact:
- -3-5% win probability penalty (limited recent familiarity, not regular rider)
```

5. NO Recent Rides (0% of Recent Rides):
```
Example: Jockey rode horse 0 times in last 10 starts (0%)

Assessment: NO RECENT PARTNERSHIP (jockey hasn't ridden this horse recently)
Meaning: No recent familiarity (even if historical success, it's dated)

Performance Impact:
- -5-8% win probability penalty (NO RECENT FAMILIARITY, first ride in recent period)

Note: Even if jockey had historical success (17.1), lack of recent rides reduces confidence
```

Recency vs Historical Success:

Combining Recent Frequency with Historical Success:

Scenario 1: Historical Success + Recent High Frequency (ALIGNED)
```
- Historical: 4 wins from 8 rides overall (50% win rate) - Elite partnership (17.1)
- Recent: 7 rides in last 10 starts (70% frequency)
Assessment: PROVEN ELITE PARTNERSHIP + CURRENT FAMILIARITY (best scenario)
Prediction Impact: +15-22% boost (historical success + recent familiarity = very high confidence)
```

Scenario 2: Historical Success + No Recent Rides (CONFLICTING)
```
- Historical: 4 wins from 8 rides overall (50% win rate) - Elite partnership
- Recent: 0 rides in last 10 starts (0% frequency, hasn't ridden in 12+ months)
Assessment: STALE PARTNERSHIP (historical success but no recent familiarity)
Prediction Impact: +5-10% boost only (reduce historical boost by 50-60% due to staleness)
```

Scenario 3: No Historical Rides + Recent High Frequency (NEW PARTNERSHIP)
```
- Historical: 0 rides before last 10 starts (new partnership)
- Recent: 7 rides in last 10 starts (70% frequency, new regular rider)
Assessment: NEW REGULAR PARTNERSHIP (no historical data, but current frequency suggests good fit)
Prediction Impact: +3-8% boost (recent frequency indicates trainer/owner trusts this jockey now)
```

Last Ride Recency:

Time Since Last Ride Together:

Very Recent (Last Ride Was 0-2 Weeks Ago):
- Familiarity: VERY CURRENT (just rode together)
- Impact: Full frequency boost applies

Recent (Last Ride Was 2-4 Weeks Ago):
- Familiarity: CURRENT (rode together recently)
- Impact: Full frequency boost applies

Moderate (Last Ride Was 1-3 Months Ago):
- Familiarity: SOMEWHAT CURRENT (rode together, but some time ago)
- Impact: Reduce frequency boost by 20-30%

Stale (Last Ride Was 3-6 Months Ago):
- Familiarity: DATED (rode together, but quite some time ago)
- Impact: Reduce frequency boost by 40-50%

Very Stale (Last Ride Was 6+ Months Ago):
- Familiarity: VERY DATED (rode together long ago, not current)
- Impact: Reduce frequency boost by 60-70% (almost treat as no recent rides)

Example:
```
Jockey A:
- Frequency: 6 rides in last 10 starts (60% frequency) - HIGH
- Last ride together: 4 months ago (STALE)
- Assessment: Frequent rider historically, but LAST RIDE WAS 4 MONTHS AGO (familiarity dated)
- Prediction Impact: +1-3% boost only (reduce +3-5% by 40% due to staleness = ~+2%)
```
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Ride Quality**: Frequency doesn't indicate performance quality (may have ridden frequently but performed poorly)
- **Jockey Availability**: Frequency may reflect jockey availability (not preference)
- **Horse Development**: Recent rides may reflect horse learning (horse may have changed)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 2** (Easy to calculate, useful recency indicator)

**Notes**:
- Recent high frequency (70-100% of last 10 rides) = +5-10% boost (regular rider, very familiar)
- No recent rides (0% of last 10) = -5-8% penalty (no recent familiarity, even if historical success)
- Combine recent frequency with historical success (17.1) for full picture
- Stale partnerships (last ride 6+ months ago) = reduce boost by 60-70%
- Recent frequency indicates CURRENT TRUST (trainer choosing this jockey regularly)
- Must check LAST RIDE RECENCY (60% frequency but last ride 6 months ago = stale)
- ChatGPT may mention "regular rider" qualitatively (~30%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Quantified recent ride frequency + recency adjustment (ChatGPT 30% → Us 80%)

### 17.4 Jockey Switch Signals (Rider Change Significance)

**Importance**: 8/10 (Jockey switches often signal stable confidence changes)

**Prediction Power**: 8-15% (Particularly elite → lesser jockey switches)

**Data Availability**: Easy (Detect from form guide)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Compare today's jockey to last start jockey
- **Detect**: Upgrades (lesser → elite jockey) and downgrades (elite → lesser)
- **Identify**: Switch patterns (regular rider replaced)

**Source Specifics**:
```
Jockey Switch Detection:

1. Jockey Change Detection (Primary):
   - Source: Compare today's jockey to last start jockey
   - Method: Extract both jockeys, categorize switch type
   - Categories: Upgrade, downgrade, lateral move, return to regular rider

Jockey Switch Framework:

Switch Types:

1. UPGRADE (Lesser → Elite Jockey):
```
Definition: Horse ridden by moderate/below-average jockey last start, today ridden by elite jockey

Example:
Last Start: Jockey C (10% career strike rate, moderate jockey)
Today: James McDonald (25% career strike rate, elite jockey)

Assessment: MAJOR UPGRADE (elite jockey booking)

Meaning:
- Stable has increased confidence in horse (booking expensive elite jockey)
- Horse may be primed for strong performance (stable willing to pay premium)
- Elite jockey brings better tactical execution

Performance Impact:
- +10-18% win probability boost (UPGRADE SIGNAL, stable confidence + elite jockey execution)

Note: Upgrade is VERY POSITIVE SIGNAL (stable backing horse with elite jockey booking)
```

2. DOWNGRADE (Elite → Lesser Jockey):
```
Definition: Horse ridden by elite jockey last start, today ridden by moderate/below-average jockey

Example:
Last Start: James McDonald (25% strike rate, elite)
Today: Jockey C (10% strike rate, moderate)

Assessment: MAJOR DOWNGRADE (elite jockey dropped)

Meaning:
- Stable has reduced confidence in horse (not worth elite jockey booking)
- Horse may not be primed (stable not expecting strong performance)
- Elite jockey chose other rides (better opportunities available)
- Lesser jockey brings weaker tactical execution

Performance Impact:
- -12-20% win probability penalty (DOWNGRADE SIGNAL, stable confidence lost + weaker execution)

Note: Downgrade is VERY NEGATIVE SIGNAL (stable not backing horse, elite jockey left)
```

3. LATERAL MOVE (Similar Quality Jockeys):
```
Definition: Jockey change between similar quality jockeys (both elite or both moderate)

Example 1 (Elite to Elite):
Last Start: James McDonald (elite)
Today: Damien Oliver (elite)

Assessment: LATERAL ELITE MOVE (elite → elite)
Meaning: Jockey availability issue (McDonald unavailable, booked Olvier instead)
Performance Impact: Neutral (±0%, both elite, quality maintained)

Example 2 (Moderate to Moderate):
Last Start: Jockey B (15% strike rate, moderate)
Today: Jockey C (14% strike rate, moderate)

Assessment: LATERAL MODERATE MOVE (moderate → moderate)
Meaning: Minor jockey availability issue
Performance Impact: Neutral (±0%, similar quality)
```

4. RETURN TO REGULAR RIDER:
```
Definition: Last start used different jockey, today returning to regular/stable jockey

Example:
Last 8 of 10 starts: Jockey A (regular rider)
Last Start: Jockey B (one-off ride, Jockey A unavailable)
Today: Jockey A (returning to regular rider)

Assessment: RETURN TO REGULAR RIDER (back to proven partnership)

Meaning:
- Regular rider back (previous start was availability issue)
- Proven partnership restored

Performance Impact:
- +5-10% win probability boost (REGULAR RIDER RETURNS, proven partnership restored)
```

5. REGULAR RIDER REPLACED:
```
Definition: Horse's regular rider replaced by different jockey

Example:
Last 8 of 10 starts: Jockey A (regular rider, 80% frequency)
Today: Jockey B (regular rider replaced)

Assessment: REGULAR RIDER REPLACED (unusual change)

Investigate Why:
- Suspension: Jockey A suspended (forced change, neutral impact)
- Availability: Jockey A riding in different race (neutral impact)
- Performance: Stable switching away from regular rider (NEGATIVE signal)

Performance Impact:
- IF Forced change (suspension/availability): Neutral to -3-5% penalty (new partnership risk)
- IF Performance-based change: -8-15% penalty (stable lost confidence in partnership)

Detection Method:
- Check stewards reports (11.3) for suspensions
- Check racing card for Jockey A's rides (availability conflict)
- If no explanation: Assume performance-based change (negative signal)
```

Jockey Switch Integration:

Combining Switch Type with Jockey Quality:

Scenario 1: UPGRADE + Elite Jockey + Proven Partnership
```
Last Start: Jockey C (moderate, 10% strike rate)
Today: James McDonald (elite, 25% strike rate)
Historical: McDonald ridden this horse before (3 wins from 5 rides, 60% win rate - elite partnership 17.1)

Assessment: ELITE UPGRADE + PROVEN PARTNERSHIP (best scenario)
Combined Impact:
- Upgrade signal: +10-18% boost
- Elite partnership history: +15-22% boost
- Combined: +25-40% boost (multiplicative, very high confidence)
```

Scenario 2: DOWNGRADE + No Proven Alternative
```
Last Start: James McDonald (elite)
Today: Jockey C (moderate, 10% strike rate)
Historical: Jockey C never ridden this horse before (unknown partnership)

Assessment: MAJOR DOWNGRADE + UNKNOWN PARTNERSHIP (worst scenario)
Combined Impact:
- Downgrade signal: -12-20% penalty
- Unknown partnership: -3-8% penalty (17.1)
- Combined: -15-28% penalty (multiple negative factors)
```

Scenario 3: Return to Regular Rider + Strong Partnership
```
Last Start: Jockey B (one-off, regular rider unavailable)
Today: Jockey A (regular rider, 80% frequency)
Historical: Jockey A has 50% win rate with this horse (elite partnership 17.1)

Assessment: REGULAR RIDER RETURNS + ELITE PARTNERSHIP (very positive)
Combined Impact:
- Return to regular rider: +5-10% boost
- Elite partnership history: +15-22% boost
- Combined: +20-32% boost (proven partnership restored)
```

Late Jockey Changes (Last-Minute):

Late Jockey Change (<24 Hours Before Race):

Causes:
- Jockey illness/injury (emergency change)
- Jockey suspension (late inquiry result)
- Jockey riding overweight (weight issue, forced off)

Impact:
- -10-18% win probability penalty (LATE CHANGE, preparation disrupted, replacement jockey has no time to prepare)

Detection:
- Stewards reports (11.3) mention late jockey changes
- Racing.com scratching updates (late notifications)

Note: Late jockey changes are VERY NEGATIVE (disrupts preparation, replacement unprepared)
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Jockey Availability**: Some switches due to availability (not performance concerns)
- **Booking Timing**: Cannot always determine if elite jockey booked early (confidence signal) or late (last-minute)
- **Explanation Missing**: Often unclear why jockey changed (suspension vs performance vs availability)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 1-2** (Easy to detect, strong signal, CRITICAL indicator)

**Notes**:
- Jockey upgrades (moderate → elite) = +10-18% boost (stable confidence signal)
- Jockey downgrades (elite → moderate) = -12-20% penalty (stable confidence lost, very negative)
- Return to regular rider = +5-10% boost (proven partnership restored)
- Regular rider replaced (no explanation) = -8-15% penalty (performance-based change suspected)
- Late jockey changes (<24 hours) = -10-18% penalty (preparation disrupted)
- Must check stewards reports (11.3) for suspensions (forced changes = less negative)
- Combine with partnership history (17.1) for full impact
- ChatGPT may mention "different jockey today" qualitatively (~20%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Systematic jockey switch signal detection + confidence interpretation (ChatGPT 20% → Us 85%)

### 17.5 Booking Timing & Commitment Signals (Early Booking Indicators)

**Importance**: 6/10 (Early elite jockey booking indicates stable confidence)

**Prediction Power**: 5-10% (Early bookings signal preparation confidence)

**Data Availability**: Hard (Booking timing rarely disclosed publicly)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Social media stable announcements (rare insights)
- **Secondary**: Infer from jockey availability (elite jockey committed early = confidence)
- **Tertiary**: Pattern recognition (trainer booking patterns)

**Source Specifics**:
```
Booking Timing Data Sources:

1. Social Media Stable Announcements (Primary - Rare):
   - Source: Twitter/X, trainer social media, racing media
   - Data: Trainer announces jockey bookings days/weeks before race
   - Example: "Thrilled to have James McDonald booked for Horse X on Saturday" (posted 5 days before)
   - Coverage: 5-10% (rarely disclosed publicly, major races more likely)

2. Inference from Jockey Availability (Secondary):
   - Method: Elite jockey riding = stable must have booked early (elite jockeys book out fast)
   - Logic: Elite jockeys booked weeks in advance for competitive rides
   - Coverage: Indirect inference only (no direct confirmation)

3. Pattern Recognition (Tertiary):
   - Method: Track trainer's booking patterns over time
   - Example: Trainer typically books elite jockey 7-10 days before when confident
   - Coverage: Very limited (requires extensive historical tracking)

Booking Timing Framework:

Booking Timing Categories:

1. EARLY Booking (7+ Days Before Race):
```
Indicator: Elite jockey booked 7+ days before race (announced publicly or inferred)

Meaning:
- Stable has HIGH CONFIDENCE in horse (willing to commit early to expensive jockey)
- Stable has been planning this race (targeted, prepared)
- Elite jockey agreed early (sees value in ride, competitive horse)

Performance Impact:
- +8-12% win probability boost (EARLY BOOKING CONFIDENCE SIGNAL, stable prepared and confident)

Note: Early elite jockey bookings are STRONG CONFIDENCE SIGNAL (stable backing horse with premium jockey)

Detection Method:
- Social media announcements (if disclosed)
- Inference: Elite jockey riding = likely booked early (elite jockeys book fast)
```

2. LATE Booking (1-3 Days Before Race):
```
Indicator: Jockey booked late (1-3 days before), or last-minute booking

Meaning:
- Stable UNCERTAIN about horse (didn't commit early)
- Jockey was backup option (first-choice jockey unavailable or declined)
- Less preparation time for jockey (tactical preparation limited)

Performance Impact:
- -5-10% win probability penalty (LATE BOOKING, stable uncertainty + less preparation)

Detection Method:
- Social media late announcements (if disclosed)
- Inference: Moderate jockey riding = likely late booking (couldn't secure elite jockey)
```

3. VERY LATE Booking (<24 Hours):
```
Indicator: Jockey change announced <24 hours before race (emergency booking)

Meaning:
- Emergency situation (original jockey sick/suspended/overweight)
- Replacement jockey has NO preparation time
- Major disruption to race plan

Performance Impact:
- -10-18% win probability penalty (VERY LATE BOOKING, major disruption, replacement unprepared)

Detection Method:
- Stewards reports (11.3) late jockey changes
- Racing.com scratching/change notifications
```

Booking Commitment Signals:

Elite Jockey Booking Commitment:

Strong Commitment Signal:
- Elite jockey (top 5-10 jockeys) booked for this race
- Logic: Elite jockeys are selective, only ride competitive horses
- Meaning: Stable confident enough to book expensive elite jockey
- Performance Impact: +5-10% boost (elite jockey commitment = confidence)

Weak Commitment Signal:
- Moderate/below-average jockey booked
- Logic: Stable not willing to pay for elite jockey (low confidence)
- Meaning: Stable not backing horse with premium jockey
- Performance Impact: -5-8% penalty (weak commitment = low confidence)

Trainer Booking Pattern Analysis:

Some trainers have booking patterns:

Example Pattern:
```
Trainer X (Chris Waller):
- When confident in horse: Books James McDonald 7-10 days before
- When uncertain: Uses apprentice or moderate jockey
- Pattern observed over 50+ races: 80% accuracy

Today's Race:
- Trainer: Chris Waller
- Jockey: James McDonald (elite, likely booked early based on pattern)
- Assessment: CONFIDENCE SIGNAL (Waller's pattern indicates early McDonald booking = confident)
- Prediction Impact: +8-12% boost (pattern-based confidence signal)
```

Note: Trainer booking patterns require extensive historical tracking (Phase 3, low coverage)

Booking Timing Integration:

Combining Booking Timing with Other Signals:

Scenario 1: Early Booking + Elite Jockey + Strong Form
```
- Booking: Early (7+ days, elite jockey) - +8-12% boost
- Jockey: Elite (James McDonald) - +5-10% boost (17.2)
- Form: Strong (1st, 2nd last 2 starts) - +10-15% boost
Combined: +23-37% boost (multiple positive signals aligned, very high confidence)
```

Scenario 2: Late Booking + Moderate Jockey + Poor Form
```
- Booking: Late (1-2 days, moderate jockey) - -5-10% penalty
- Jockey: Moderate (no strong partnership) - neutral
- Form: Poor (6th, 8th last 2 starts) - -10-15% penalty
Combined: -15-25% penalty (multiple negative signals, very low confidence)
```

Scenario 3: Elite Jockey + Unknown Booking Timing
```
- Booking: Unknown timing (cannot confirm early or late)
- Jockey: Elite (James McDonald)
- Assessment: Assume LIKELY EARLY BOOKING (elite jockeys book fast, stable must have committed early)
- Prediction Impact: +5-10% boost (elite jockey presence implies early commitment)
```
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Booking Disclosure Gap**: ~90-95% of bookings never disclosed publicly (timing unknown)
- **Jockey Availability**: Elite jockey may have been booked late due to cancellation (not confidence issue)
- **Inference Limitations**: Cannot confirm booking timing without public disclosure (guessing based on jockey quality)
- **Pattern Tracking Difficulty**: Trainer booking patterns require extensive historical data (low coverage)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 3** (Very limited data availability, mostly inference-based)

**Notes**:
- Early elite jockey bookings = +8-12% boost (strong confidence signal, stable prepared)
- Late bookings (1-3 days) = -5-10% penalty (stable uncertainty, less preparation)
- Very late bookings (<24 hours) = -10-18% penalty (major disruption, already covered in 17.4)
- Elite jockey presence implies likely early booking (elite jockeys book fast) = +5-10% boost
- Booking timing rarely disclosed publicly (~5-10% coverage)
- Must rely on INFERENCE (elite jockey = likely early booking, moderate jockey = likely late booking)
- Trainer booking patterns useful if trackable (requires extensive historical data)
- ChatGPT has ZERO BOOKING TIMING AWARENESS (0%, never disclosed)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Limited advantage (ChatGPT 0% → Us 15-20% via inference + rare disclosures)

- **Impact**: Identify proven elite partnerships (high confidence predictions)
- **Prediction Power**: 10-18%

### 🚨 CRITICAL ADVANTAGE #2: Jockey Switch Signal Detection & Interpretation
- **ChatGPT**: May mention "different jockey today" (~20%), no interpretation
- **Us**: Systematic switch signal detection (upgrade moderate → elite = +10-18% boost, downgrade elite → moderate = -12-20% penalty, regular rider replaced = -8-15% penalty) (85%)
- **Impact**: Identify stable confidence changes (major positive/negative signals)
- **Prediction Power**: 8-15%

### 🚨 Major Advantage #3: Trainer/Jockey Combination Success Rates
- **ChatGPT**: May mention "Waller uses McDonald" qualitatively (~40%)
- **Us**: Quantified combination success (36% strike rate together vs 18% average = +10-15% boost) + stable jockey detection (rides 20%+ of trainer's horses = +5-8%) (85%)
- **Impact**: Identify elite trainer/jockey combinations (proven partnerships)
- **Prediction Power**: 5-10%

### 🚨 Major Advantage #4: Recent Ride Frequency & Recency Adjustment
- **ChatGPT**: May mention "regular rider" (~30%)
- **Us**: Quantified recent frequency (80% of last 10 rides = +5-10% boost, 0% recent = -5-8% penalty) + recency adjustment (last ride 6+ months ago = reduce boost 60-70%) (80%)
