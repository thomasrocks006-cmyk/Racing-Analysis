## CATEGORY 15: RACE REPLAYS & VISUAL ANALYSIS ⭐⭐

**Overall Category Assessment**:
- **Category Importance**: 8/10 (Visual evidence of performance)
- **Category Prediction Power**: 10-15% (Expert human analysis of replays)
- **ChatGPT Coverage**: 0% visual analysis → **Our Goal**: 40% human-assisted analysis
- **Priority**: Phase 3 (human-assisted, cannot fully automate yet)

**Key Insight**: Race replays provide VISUAL EVIDENCE that text cannot capture (wide runs, checks, tactics). Requires human observation or future AI vision capabilities.

**🚨 CRITICAL LIMITATION**: Cannot fully automate video analysis with current technology. Requires human observation or future AI vision models (GPT-5 vision, Claude vision, Gemini video understanding).

   - Format: Video replays (official)
   - Quality: HIGH
   - Method: Video streaming

Race Replay Analysis Categories:

1. Excuses (Legitimate Bad Luck):
   - Visual Evidence: Checked heavily (interfered with, lost momentum)
   - Visual Evidence: Raced wide throughout (no cover, extra distance)
   - Visual Evidence: Blocked for clear run (jockey had to check, couldn't get through)
   - Visual Evidence: Stumbled at start (lost 3-5 lengths, impossible to recover)
   - Visual Evidence: Difficult barrier (wide, forced wide immediately)

   Example Excuse (Checked Heavily):
   ```
   Last Start Replay Observation:
   - Horse X approaching straight, 3rd position, traveling well
   - 200m to go: Runner in front shifted out suddenly (interference)
   - Horse X checked heavily (jockey had to pull hard to avoid collision)
   - Horse X lost all momentum, fell back to 6th
   - Assessment: LEGITIMATE EXCUSE (bad luck, not poor performance)
   - Prediction Impact: FORGIVE POOR RESULT COMPLETELY (+15-20% boost, ignore last start result)
   ```

2. Hidden Strengths (Better Than Result Suggests):
   - Visual Evidence: Raced wide but still finished strong (extra ground covered, very impressive)
   - Visual Evidence: No clear run but tried to push through (good effort, unlucky)
   - Visual Evidence: Sat three-wide entire race but still placed (very tough run, elite effort)
   - Visual Evidence: Closing fast at finish (strong finishing sprint, needed extra 50-100m)

   Example Hidden Strength (Closing Fast):
   ```
   Last Start Replay Observation:
   - Horse Y finished 4th (moderate result on paper)
   - Replay shows: Horse Y settled last, 10 lengths off leader
   - Final 400m: Horse Y unleashed huge finishing burst
   - Passed 6 horses in straight, closing very fast at finish line
   - Assessment: MUCH BETTER THAN RESULT SUGGESTS (needed extra distance)
   - Prediction Impact: +10-15% boost (strong finishing effort, step up to 1600m today ideal)
   ```

3. Exposed Weaknesses (Worse Than Result Suggests):
   - Visual Evidence: Won but had easy time (soft lead, no pressure, flattered)
   - Visual Evidence: Struggled to hold on (caught on line, nearly beaten)
   - Visual Evidence: Weak finishing effort (faded badly final 100m, fitness concern)
   - Visual Evidence: Rider working hard entire race (horse not traveling, laboring)

   Example Exposed Weakness (Soft Lead Flattered):
   ```
   Last Start Replay Observation:
   - Horse Z won last start (looks good on paper)
   - Replay shows: Horse Z led uncontested (no other leaders, soft pace)
   - Sat in front with huge break (6 lengths clear, easy time)
   - Rivals closed fast final 200m (Horse Z barely held on)
   - Assessment: RESULT FLATTERED (easy lead, barely held on when challenged)
   - Prediction Impact: -10-15% penalty (result misleading, fast pace today will expose)
   ```

4. Running Pattern Quality:
   - Visual Evidence: Traveled smoothly entire race (good action, effortless)
   - Visual Evidence: Changed gears quickly (acceleration impressive)
   - Visual Evidence: Laboring action (poor action, struggling)
   - Visual Evidence: Rider niggling (jockey working hard, horse not responsive)

   Example Quality Pattern (Traveled Smoothly):
   ```
   Last Start Replay Observation:
   - Horse A traveled smoothly mid-pack (relaxed, good action)
   - Jockey sitting quietly (not pushing, horse traveling within itself)
   - Final 200m: Jockey asked horse to quicken (immediate response, quick acceleration)
   - Strong finishing effort (passed 3 rivals easily)
   - Assessment: HIGH QUALITY PERFORMANCE (traveled well, good acceleration)
   - Prediction Impact: +8-12% boost (quality run, good signs)
   ```

Human vs AI Video Analysis:

Current Technology (2025):
- Human Observation: 95% accuracy (expert eye can spot all nuances)
  * Time: 3-5 minutes per replay (must watch full race)
  * Cost: Labor intensive (human time = $20-40/hour = $1-3 per replay)

- GPT-5 Vision (Limited): ~40-60% accuracy (can identify major events but misses nuances)
  * Method: Feed video frames to GPT-5 vision
  * Limitations: Cannot reliably track individual horses through race, misses subtle checks/interference
  * Cost: $0.50-$1.00 per replay analysis (video frame processing expensive)

- Future AI Vision (2026+): Potentially 80-90% accuracy
  * Models: Gemini 2.0 video understanding, GPT-6 vision (future)
  * Capability: Track individual horses, detect interference, assess running patterns
  * Cost: TBD (likely $0.20-$0.50 per replay)

Current Best Approach (2025):

Hybrid Method:
1. Extract Racing.com written replay analysis (expert analysts already watched) - 70% coverage
2. For key races without written analysis: Human observation - 30% races
3. Focus on: Excuses (checks, wide runs), hidden strengths (closing fast), exposed weaknesses (soft wins)

Written Replay Analysis Extraction:

Racing.com Replay Analysis Articles:
```
Example Article:

"Race 7 Replay Analysis - Flemington 1600m:

HORSE X (4th): Had no luck throughout. Checked heavily at 400m when runner in front shifted out. Lost all momentum and never recovered. Much better than result suggests. Forgive this run.

HORSE Y (1st - Winner): Controlled race from front. Soft lead with no pressure (4+ lengths clear). Barely held on when challenged final 100m. Result flattered, will struggle against tougher opposition.

HORSE Z (6th): Sat three-wide entire race with no cover. Enormous effort to finish 6th given tough run. Extra distance covered significant. Barrier draw cost this horse today."
```

Extraction:
- Horse X: LEGITIMATE EXCUSE (checked heavily) → +15-20% boost (forgive poor result)
- Horse Y: RESULT FLATTERED (soft lead) → -10-15% penalty (misleading win)
- Horse Z: TOUGH RUN (three-wide) → +8-12% boost (better than result suggests)
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Subjectivity**: Replay interpretation subjective (different observers may disagree)
- **Coverage**: Not all races have written replay analysis (major races only)
- **Timing**: Written analysis published hours after race (not immediately available)
- **Detail Level**: Written analysis may miss subtle nuances (human watching video sees more)
- **AI Limitations**: Current AI vision cannot reliably track horses through race (technology limitation)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 3** (Human-assisted, cannot fully automate)

**Notes**:
- Race replays provide CRITICAL VISUAL EVIDENCE (checks, wide runs, finishing effort)
- Legitimate excuses (checked heavily) = COMPLETELY FORGIVE poor result (+15-20% boost)
- Hidden strengths (closing fast) = +10-15% boost (better than result suggests)
- Exposed weaknesses (soft lead flattered) = -10-15% penalty (worse than result suggests)
- Current best approach: Extract written replay analysis (70% coverage) + human observation for key races (30%)
- Cannot fully automate with current AI vision technology (GPT-5 vision ~40-60% accuracy)
- Future AI vision (2026+) may enable 80-90% automation
- ChatGPT has ZERO VISUAL ANALYSIS capability (0%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Human-assisted replay analysis (ChatGPT 0% → Us 40% human-assisted)

### 15.2 Running Style & Pattern Observation (Action Quality Assessment)

**Importance**: 7/10 (Running action quality)

**Prediction Power**: 5-8% (Good action indicates fitness)

**Data Availability**: Hard (Requires video analysis)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Visual observation from replays
- **Method**: Human observation (action quality assessment)
- **Extract**: Smooth vs laboring action, acceleration quality, fitness signs

**Source Specifics**:
```
Running Style Observation Categories:

1. Action Quality:
   - Smooth Action: Horse traveling effortlessly (good stride, balanced)
   - Laboring Action: Horse struggling (poor stride, unbalanced, working hard)

   Visual Cues:
   - Smooth: Jockey sitting still, horse relaxed, fluid stride
   - Laboring: Jockey pushing/niggling, horse's head bobbing, irregular stride

   Example Smooth Action:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse A mid-pack, jockey sitting quietly with hands still
   - Horse has fluid, rhythmic stride (balanced action)
   - Ears pricked forward (alert, comfortable)
   - Assessment: SMOOTH ACTION (high quality, good fitness)
   - Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost (good action indicates fitness)
   ```

   Example Laboring Action:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse B mid-pack, jockey niggling constantly (pushing with hands)
   - Horse has irregular stride (head bobbing, unbalanced)
   - Laboring to keep up (struggling to maintain position)
   - Assessment: LABORING ACTION (poor quality, fitness concern)
   - Prediction Impact: -8-12% penalty (poor action indicates issue)
   ```

2. Acceleration Quality:
   - Quick Acceleration: Horse responds immediately to rider's urging (good engine)
   - Slow Acceleration: Horse slow to respond (weak engine, fitness issue)

   Visual Cues:
   - Quick: Jockey asks, horse immediately quickens (instant response)
   - Slow: Jockey asks, horse takes time to respond (sluggish)

   Example Quick Acceleration:
   ```
   Replay Observation (400m mark):
   - Jockey sits down and pushes (asks horse to quicken)
   - Horse responds IMMEDIATELY (surges forward within 2-3 strides)
   - Passes 2 rivals quickly (good acceleration)
   - Assessment: QUICK ACCELERATION (good engine)
   - Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost (quality acceleration)
   ```

3. Fitness Indicators:
   - Ears Pricked: Horse alert and comfortable (good fitness)
   - Ears Back: Horse working hard or distressed (fitness concern)
   - Breathing: Normal breathing vs labored breathing (fitness indicator)
   - Pulling Up: How horse pulls up after race (fitness recovery)

   Visual Cues:
   - Fit: Ears pricked throughout, pulls up well, barely blowing
   - Unfit: Ears back, labored breathing, pulls up distressed, blowing hard

   Example Fit Horse:
   ```
   Replay Observation (entire race + after finish):
   - Horse C traveled with ears pricked entire race (alert, comfortable)
   - Finished race strongly (good finishing effort)
   - Pulled up quickly after finish (good control)
   - Barely blowing 30 seconds after race (excellent fitness)
   - Assessment: EXCELLENT FITNESS (all indicators positive)
   - Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost (fitness confirmed)
   ```

4. Tactical Pattern Quality:
   - Good Position: Horse in ideal position for running style (leader in front, closer with cover)
   - Poor Position: Horse in bad position (leader trapped, closer stuck wide)

   Visual Cues:
   - Good: Horse where jockey wants it (tactical plan executed)
   - Poor: Horse fighting for position or forced wide (tactical plan failed)

   Example Good Tactical Position:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse D (closer) settled mid-pack with cover (ideal for closer)
   - Saved ground on rail entire race (shortest trip)
   - Peeled out at 300m with clear run (perfect timing)
   - Assessment: EXCELLENT TACTICAL RIDE (plan executed perfectly)
   - Prediction Impact: +3-5% boost (tactical advantage realized)
   ```

Written Replay Analysis Extraction (Action Quality):

Racing.com Replay Analysis:
```
Example Article Excerpt:

"HORSE E (2nd): Traveled beautifully throughout. Jockey sitting quietly with hands still. Horse had ears pricked and was traveling within itself. When asked to quicken at 300m, responded immediately with strong finishing burst. High-quality performance."
```

Extraction:
- Horse E: Smooth action (traveled beautifully) + Quick acceleration (responded immediately) + Fit (ears pricked)
- Assessment: HIGH QUALITY PERFORMANCE
- Prediction Impact: +8-12% boost (all action quality indicators positive)
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Observer Expertise**: Requires experienced eye to assess action quality (not beginner-friendly)
- **Video Angle**: Camera angles may not show action clearly (distance shots vs close-ups)
- **Subjectivity**: Action quality somewhat subjective (one observer's "smooth" is another's "moderate")
- **Coverage**: Written analysis doesn't always describe action quality (focus on race events instead)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 3** (Human observation required, cannot automate)

**Notes**:
- Running action quality indicates FITNESS and FORM
- Smooth action + quick acceleration = +5-8% boost (good fitness signs)
- Laboring action + slow acceleration = -8-12% penalty (fitness concerns)
- Ears pricked + pulls up well = excellent fitness (+5-8%)
- Ears back + blowing hard = poor fitness (-8-12%)
- Requires EXPERT HUMAN OBSERVATION (cannot automate with current AI)
- Written replay analysis sometimes describes action quality (extract when available)
- ChatGPT has ZERO ACTION QUALITY ASSESSMENT (0%)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Human observation of action quality (ChatGPT 0% → Us 30% human-assisted)

### 15.3 Incident & Interference Review (Bad Luck Identification)

**Importance**: 9/10 (Identifying legitimate excuses)

**Prediction Power**: 10-15% (Severe interference completely excuses poor result)

**Data Availability**: Medium (Stewards reports + replay observation)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Stewards reports (11.1) - official incident documentation
- **Secondary**: Visual replay confirmation (human observation)
- **Extract**: Checks, interference, wide runs, blocked runs

**Source Specifics**:
```
Incident Review Data Sources:

1. Stewards Reports (Primary - Category 11.1):
   - URL: https://www.racingnsw.com.au / https://www.racing.com
   - Data: Official incident reports (checks, interference, inquiry results)
   - Quality: AUTHORITATIVE (official regulatory documentation)
   - Coverage: 100% (all significant incidents documented)
   - Method: Web scraping (already covered in Part 3d)

2. Visual Replay Confirmation (Secondary):
   - Method: Watch replay to assess severity of incident
   - Purpose: Verify stewards report + assess impact severity
   - Time: 1-2 minutes (watch incident moment only)

Incident Categories & Impact:

1. SEVERE Interference (Checked Heavily):
   - Description: Horse checked heavily, lost all momentum, impossible to recover
   - Stewards Report: "Checked heavily at 300m, lost all chance"
   - Visual Confirmation: Horse pulled back sharply, gap closed, fell back several lengths
   - Impact: COMPLETELY FORGIVE POOR RESULT (+15-20% boost)
   - Reasoning: Result entirely due to bad luck, not horse's ability

   Example:
   ```
   Stewards Report: "Horse X checked heavily at 300m when runner in front shifted out. Lost all chance."
   Replay Observation: Horse X traveling 2nd, positioned well. At 300m, leader shifted out suddenly (no room). Jockey had to check hard (pull reins sharply). Horse X lost 4+ lengths in 50m, fell to 8th.
   Assessment: SEVERE INTERFERENCE (completely forgive poor result)
   Prediction Impact: +18-22% boost (totally forgive 8th place, treat as if never happened)
   ```

2. MODERATE Interference (Checked, Some Impact):
   - Description: Horse checked, lost momentum briefly, recovered somewhat
   - Stewards Report: "Checked at 400m"
   - Visual Confirmation: Horse steadied, lost 1-2 lengths, continued racing
   - Impact: PARTIALLY FORGIVE RESULT (+8-12% boost)
   - Reasoning: Bad luck affected result, but not total disaster

   Example:
   ```
   Stewards Report: "Horse Y checked at 400m."
   Replay Observation: Horse Y traveling 4th. At 400m, gap tightened slightly. Jockey steadied briefly, lost 1-2 lengths, continued.
   Assessment: MODERATE INTERFERENCE (some bad luck, but not severe)
   Prediction Impact: +10-12% boost (partially forgive result, had some impact)
   ```

3. MINOR Interference (Slight Check):
   - Description: Horse slightly interfered with, minimal impact
   - Stewards Report: "Steadied at 500m" (minor mention)
   - Visual Confirmation: Very brief check, minimal impact
   - Impact: SMALL ADJUSTMENT (+3-5% boost)
   - Reasoning: Minor bad luck, but not significant

4. Wide Run (No Cover):
   - Description: Horse raced wide entire race (extra distance, no cover)
   - Stewards Report: May not be mentioned (not "interference" per se)
   - Visual Confirmation: Horse three-wide or four-wide, extra ground covered
   - Impact: EXCUSE POOR RESULT (+8-12% boost)
   - Reasoning: Extra distance covered = harder run, performance better than result

   Example:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse Z drawn wide barrier (11)
   - Forced to settle three-wide with no cover (entire race)
   - Extra ground covered: Estimated 8-12 meters (significant)
   - Finished 5th (moderate result on paper)
   - Assessment: TOUGH RUN (wide entire race, extra distance)
   - Prediction Impact: +10-12% boost (performance better than result, draw cost horse)
   ```

5. Blocked for Run (No Clear Running):
   - Description: Horse had no clear run in straight (boxed in, had to check/wait)
   - Stewards Report: "Held up for clear run from 300m to 200m"
   - Visual Confirmation: Horse hemmed in, jockey pulling/checking, finally got clear late
   - Impact: EXCUSE POOR RESULT (+10-15% boost)
   - Reasoning: Had to wait for room, lost crucial momentum at key moment

   Example:
   ```
   Stewards Report: "Horse A held up for clear run from 300m to 200m."
   Replay Observation: Horse A positioned 5th turning for home. Runner in front and outside blocked path. Jockey pulling hard (trying to find gap). Finally got clear at 200m but too late. Finished 6th.
   Assessment: BLOCKED FOR RUN (legitimate excuse, no clear running)
   - Prediction Impact: +12-15% boost (was traveling well, blocked at crucial moment)
   ```

Incident Impact Integration:

Severity Assessment Framework:

Severe Interference (Checked Heavily):
- Impact: +15-20% boost
- Application: COMPLETELY FORGIVE poor result (treat last start as if it didn't happen)

Moderate Interference (Checked):
- Impact: +8-12% boost
- Application: PARTIALLY FORGIVE result (still had some chance, but bad luck)

Wide Run (Three-Wide+):
- Impact: +8-12% boost
- Application: Better than result suggests (extra distance covered)

Blocked for Run:
- Impact: +10-15% boost
- Application: Legitimate excuse (was traveling well, blocked at key moment)

Minor Interference:
- Impact: +3-5% boost
- Application: Small adjustment (minor bad luck)

Combining with Stewards Reports:

Best Approach:
1. Extract stewards report incident (authoritative, 100% coverage) - Category 11.1
2. If severe incident reported, optionally watch replay to confirm severity (1-2 min)
3. Apply impact adjustment based on severity

Note: Stewards reports are SUFFICIENT for most incident assessment (don't need to watch every replay, only severe incidents worth visual confirmation)
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Incident Severity Subjectivity**: Severity assessment somewhat subjective (observers may disagree)
- **Context Missing**: Some incidents may be horse's fault (shifted out first, caused interference)
- **Overuse Risk**: Must not excuse EVERY poor result (some poor runs have no excuse)
- **Visual Confirmation Time**: Watching replays time-consuming (1-2 min per incident)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 1** (Use stewards reports from 11.1, Phase 3 for visual confirmation)

**Notes**:
- Incident review identifies LEGITIMATE EXCUSES (checks, interference, wide runs)
- Severe interference (checked heavily) = COMPLETELY FORGIVE result (+15-20% boost)
- Wide run (three-wide no cover) = +8-12% boost (extra distance covered)
- Blocked for run (hemmed in) = +10-15% boost (legitimate excuse)
- **PRIMARY DATA SOURCE**: Stewards reports (Category 11.1, already covered) - 100% coverage, authoritative
- **SECONDARY**: Visual replay confirmation (optional, for severe incidents only)
- Visual confirmation mainly for SEVERE incidents (check if "checked heavily" truly severe)
- Don't need to watch every replay (stewards reports sufficient for most incidents)
- ChatGPT has ZERO INCIDENT ASSESSMENT (0% access to stewards reports OR replays)
- **🚨 COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Stewards reports + optional visual confirmation (ChatGPT 0% → Us 75% via stewards, 85% with visual)

### 15.4 Jockey Tactics & Execution Analysis (Ride Quality Assessment)

**Importance**: 7/10 (Jockey execution quality)

**Prediction Power**: 5-8% (Poor ride can cost horse race)

**Data Availability**: Hard (Requires video analysis + expert judgment)

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Visual replay observation (human assessment)
- **Secondary**: Post-race jockey comments (11.2) - jockey explains tactics
- **Extract**: Tactical execution quality, ride mistakes, tactical brilliance

**Source Specifics**:
```
Jockey Tactics Analysis Categories:

1. Tactical Execution Quality:
   - Excellent Execution: Jockey executed tactical plan perfectly (perfect timing, positioning)
   - Poor Execution: Jockey made tactical errors (wrong position, bad timing)

   Visual Cues:
   - Excellent: Horse in ideal position for running style, clear run when needed, perfect timing
   - Poor: Horse in wrong position, blocked/wide, premature move or too late

   Example Excellent Execution:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse A (closer), jockey settled mid-pack with cover (ideal for closer)
   - Saved ground on rail entire race (efficient trip)
   - 300m: Jockey spotted gap opening on inside (awareness)
   - Peeled out through gap at perfect moment (timing)
   - Clear run to line, finished strongly (tactical plan executed)
   - Assessment: EXCELLENT TACTICAL RIDE (textbook)
   - Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost (jockey helped horse maximize performance)
   ```

   Example Poor Execution:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse B (closer), jockey rushed forward to settle on pace (wrong position for closer)
   - Used energy early in race to secure position (energy wasted)
   - 400m: Jockey asked horse to quicken (too early for closer)
   - Horse weakened final 100m (energy spent, wrong tactics)
   - Finished 7th (poor result)
   - Assessment: POOR TACTICAL RIDE (jockey cost horse)
   - Prediction Impact: -8-12% penalty if same jockey today (rider error likely repeated)
   - Positive: +5-8% boost if DIFFERENT jockey today (new rider may execute better)
   ```

2. Ride Mistakes (Jockey Errors):
   - Too Aggressive: Jockey pushed horse too hard too early (burned energy)
   - Too Conservative: Jockey waited too long (left run too late)
   - Wrong Position: Jockey settled horse in wrong position (too forward/too back for style)
   - Blocked Unnecessarily: Jockey got horse boxed in (poor positioning, avoidable)

   Example Too Aggressive (Energy Wasted):
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse C (stayer), jockey rushed to lead (aggressive early tactics)
   - Set fast pace (54.2 first 800m = very fast)
   - 600m: Horse already under pressure (energy spent)
   - Weakened badly final 400m (exhausted from fast pace)
   - Assessment: JOCKEY TOO AGGRESSIVE (burned horse out)
   - Prediction Impact:
     * Same jockey today: -8-12% penalty (rider error concern)
     * Different jockey today: +8-12% boost (new rider won't repeat mistake)
   ```

3. Tactical Brilliance (Exceptional Ride):
   - Perfect Timing: Jockey timed run perfectly (not too early, not too late)
   - Creative Tactics: Jockey found creative solution (switched inside/outside cleverly)
   - Saved Ground: Jockey saved significant ground (efficient trip)

   Example Tactical Brilliance:
   ```
   Replay Observation:
   - Horse D (closer), settled last (7 lengths off pace)
   - 600m: Runners fanned wide (outside all taken)
   - Jockey saw gap on inside rail (awareness)
   - 300m: Jockey threaded horse through narrow gap on inside (skill)
   - Clear run, horse surged to win (brilliant ride)
   - Assessment: TACTICAL BRILLIANCE (jockey maximized horse's chances)
   - Prediction Impact: +5-8% boost if same jockey today (skilled rider, trust execution)
   ```

4. Post-Race Jockey Comments (Tactical Explanation):
   - Source: Stewards reports (11.2) - jockey explains tactics
   - Value: Jockey provides context for tactical decisions

   Example Jockey Comment:
   ```
   Post-Race Comment (Stewards Report):
   "Jockey reported Horse E was unable to obtain clear running from 300m to 200m and shifted out near 200m to obtain clear running."

   Interpretation:
   - Jockey was blocked (not jockey's fault, field crowding)
   - Found clear running eventually (good awareness)
   - Assessment: REASONABLE RIDE (blocked, but found solution)
   - Prediction Impact: Neutral (jockey did best given circumstances)
   ```

Jockey Consistency Analysis:

Track Jockey's Ride Quality Over Time:
- Calculate: % of rides with tactical errors (poor execution rate)
- Elite jockeys: <5% tactical error rate (rarely make mistakes)
- Average jockeys: 10-15% tactical error rate
- Below-average jockeys: 20%+ tactical error rate (frequent mistakes)

Example:
```
Jockey X Last 20 Rides:
- 2 rides with tactical errors (too aggressive, wrong position)
- Tactical error rate: 10% (2/20)
- Assessment: AVERAGE JOCKEY (occasional mistakes, mostly solid)

Jockey Y (Elite - James McDonald) Last 20 Rides:
- 0 rides with tactical errors
- Tactical error rate: 0% (0/20)
- Assessment: ELITE JOCKEY (near-perfect execution)
```

Application:
- Elite jockey (0-5% error rate): +3-5% boost (trust execution)
- Average jockey (10-15% error rate): Neutral (±0%)
- Below-average jockey (20%+ error rate): -5-8% penalty (execution concern)

Jockey Change Impact (Tactical Execution):

IF Last start poor execution (jockey error) AND Different jockey today:
  THEN +8-12% boost (new jockey won't repeat same mistake)

IF Last start excellent execution (tactical brilliance) AND Same jockey today:
  THEN +5-8% boost (trust jockey to execute well again)

IF Last start poor execution AND Same jockey today:
  THEN -8-12% penalty (rider error concern, may repeat)
```

**Missing Variables**:
- **Subjectivity**: Ride quality assessment highly subjective (expert observers may disagree)
- **Context Missing**: Some "errors" may be forced by circumstances (horse not responding, field congestion)
- **Attribution Difficulty**: Hard to separate jockey skill from horse ability (was it good ride or good horse?)
- **Coverage**: Visual assessment requires watching replays (time-consuming, cannot automate)

**Implementation Priority**: **Phase 3** (Human observation, expert judgment required)

**Notes**:
- Jockey tactics can SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT result (good ride helps, poor ride costs)
- Poor tactical execution (wrong position, bad timing) = -8-12% penalty if same jockey
- Poor tactical execution BUT different jockey today = +8-12% boost (new rider opportunity)
- Excellent tactical execution + same jockey = +5-8% boost (trust execution)
- Elite jockeys (0-5% error rate) = +3-5% boost (trust execution)
- Below-average jockeys (20%+ error rate) = -5-8% penalty (execution concern)

## MISSING VARIABLES IDENTIFIED (Part 4d):

### Category 15: Race Replays & Visual Analysis
- Subjectivity (replay interpretation varies by observer)
- Coverage (not all races have written replay analysis)
- Timing (written analysis published hours after race)
- Detail level (written analysis may miss nuances)
- AI limitations (current AI vision ~40-60% accuracy, cannot reliably track horses)
- Observer expertise (action quality requires experienced eye)
- Video angle (camera angles may not show action clearly)
- Subjectivity (action quality somewhat subjective)
- Coverage (written analysis doesn't always describe action)
- Incident severity subjectivity (observers may disagree on severity)
- Context missing (some incidents horse's fault)
- Overuse risk (must not excuse every poor result)
- Visual confirmation time (time-consuming, 1-2 min per incident)
- Ride quality subjectivity (highly subjective assessment)
- Context missing (some "errors" forced by circumstances)
- Attribution difficulty (hard to separate jockey skill from horse ability)
- Coverage (requires watching replays, time-consuming)

## DATA ACQUISITION SUMMARY (Part 4d):

### Medium Access (Stewards Reports - Already Covered):
- Incident documentation (Racing NSW/VIC stewards reports - free, 100% coverage)
- Post-race jockey comments (stewards reports - free)
- **Note**: Already covered in Part 3d (Category 11.1, 11.2)

### Hard Access (Human-Assisted Visual Analysis):
- Race replay observation (Racing.com videos - free but requires human viewing)
- Written replay analysis extraction (Racing.com articles - free but limited coverage ~70%)
- Action quality assessment (requires expert human observation)
- Jockey tactics assessment (requires expert human judgment)

### Very Hard Access (Cannot Automate with Current Technology):
- AI vision analysis (GPT-5 vision ~40-60% accuracy, $0.50-$1.00 per replay, unreliable for horse tracking)
- Future AI vision (2026+, potentially 80-90% accuracy with Gemini video/GPT-6 vision)

## TECHNOLOGY LIMITATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT:

**Current State (2025)**:
- Cannot fully automate race replay analysis with AI vision (GPT-5 vision ~40-60% accuracy)
- AI vision cannot reliably:
  * Track individual horses through race (multiple horses, visual occlusion)
  * Detect subtle checks/interference (requires nuanced understanding)
  * Assess action quality (smooth vs laboring requires expert eye)
  * Evaluate jockey tactics (highly subjective, contextual)

**Best Current Approach**:
- **Primary**: Stewards reports (11.1) for incident documentation (75% coverage, free)
- **Secondary**: Written replay analysis extraction (70% coverage, mostly automated)
- **Tertiary**: Selective human observation for key races (30% races, human labor)

**Future State (2026+)**:
- Advanced AI vision (Gemini 2.0 video, GPT-6 vision) may enable 80-90% automation
- Estimated timeline: 12-18 months (2026 mid-year)
- Estimated cost: $0.20-$0.50 per replay (more affordable than GPT-5 vision)

**Implementation Recommendation**:
- **Phase 1**: Use stewards reports (already covered in 11.1) - sufficient for incident review
- **Phase 2**: Add written replay analysis extraction - good coverage (70%) with low cost
- **Phase 3**: Add selective human observation - for key races only (30%)
- **Future**: Monitor AI vision technology improvements, re-evaluate in 2026
